This repo was created for interview purposes:

- Architecture: MVVM
- SwiftUI: page transitions + previews
- json rest api: simple networking code: GET
- UI Design: Infinite loading loop, List + error handling
- Unit tests

Recommendations
1. For complex JSON objects you may use Objet Mapper library
2. For rest APIs you can use Alamofire -> possible new attack vector?
